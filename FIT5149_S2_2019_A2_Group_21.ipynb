       "1  Flirted with giving this two stars, but that's a pretty damning rating for what might have just been an off night...\\r\\n\\r\\nNew to the East side, and so we don't know many of these hidden gems, but me and the fiance met her friend for drinks here and ended up getting some things to nibble. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, service was pretty slow, which was unusual because the restaurant is pretty small and galley style. You would think it would be easy for servers to routinely hit up tables as you pass by. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fiance ordered the Quinoa Salad, and said it was pretty good, but dry. I wasn't too hungry and so I simply ordered the Bruchetta 3-way which came with burnt crostinis. And I ordered a side of fries, which were either hard or chewy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend ordered the macaroni & cheese, and added chicken and bacon (her usual order) and liked it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCan't remember the last time I thought to myself- \"Huh... they failed at fries...\" So, like I said- two stars. But, the decor was good, it was a good place to have a conversation, and I might be back to try more expensive fare, but-... ah... the fry thing... yeeesh... I dunno, man...   \n",
       "2  I was staying at planet Hollywood across the street and saw good reviews on this place so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We love a good breakfast sandwich. We both ordered the bacon egg and cheese, cold brew, a biscuit and a salted caramel cookie. Everything tasted amazing! The egg is medium so it pops when you take a bite so be prepared for that. The cookie was absolutely delicious and the biscuit was soft and fluffy. We got there are around 10:30am and there was a line already. Luckily the line moves very quick and we were able to find seating. Highly recommend this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3  Food is good but prices are super expensive.  8 bucks for the \"Extra Large\" Carne Asada burrito and it's a little bigger then a Taco Bell bean burrito.  Don't get me wrong, it's good carne asada but you can get one at Filibertos and it's literally three times the size for 3 bucks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLower your prices or make the portions bigger - don't forget that you're using the cheapest cut of beef you can buy, marinating it with some orange juice, garlic and onions and then grilling it.

A gentleman by the name of Jesus that works there every time you call for an update because they say they will call you and never do he makes you feel like your bothering him and then he says he will call you back with an update and never do.

Now obviously i am one that has a love/hate relationship with spots that are touristy and well known but in this case it was worth it. I liked the fact that we walked down a nice cobblestone corridor then was greeted by the hostess who promptly showed us to our table. Our seating was right in front where they had two jazz players performing throughout the lunch playing soft melodies for all of the diners entertainment and i always believe with soothing music a meal is always made more enjoyable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking around this was definite a place i could fall in love with, beautiful flower bed arrangements with different colors that made the restaurant really pop, the large umbrella's which provided a nice cool atmosphere and most importantly shade, plus birds flying around during the meal and  nicely arranged plants i loved the ambiance. The food on the other hand could be improved, with such a nicely designed restaurant i would expect a vast selection, also my gf suggested that when your in a new place you should try new food and i 100% agree with that, but in this case i should have just gotten the salmon, because everything else i looked at on the menu, i just was not feeling. Had the veal meatballs style dish and it wasn't that great i'd say it was at best a 6 out of 10 if i had to grade it. But overall the decor/ambiance made up for that. Plus our waitress was extremely helpful/friendly. I also agree with some of the reviews a bit overpriced for what they were serving.</td>\n",

I love how it is connected to a hotel with easy access from inside, also the decor was very modern and hipster-ish.  This \"new age\" restaurant atmosphere that numbers of restaurant owners have adopted is so amazing.  The Nook sets the ambiance to a very relaxed, comfortable feeling which makes it great to come in groups. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe mixologist Dustin is very skillful, and constructed the drink menu himself from my understanding.  He definitely sets the bar for any other bartender out there.  By experimenting with different aromas all the way to different types of seasonings.  He truly makes it a day to remember.

Brand spankin new building and all. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo we went across the street to Native NewYorker and got seated immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1  On my first to Montreal with my gf we came here to eat a nice mid day lunch before walking around more and departing from Montreal. Now obviously i am one that has a love/hate relationship with spots that are touristy and well known but in this case it was worth it. I liked the fact that we walked down a nice cobblestone corridor then was greeted by the hostess who promptly showed us to our table. Our seating was right in front where they had two jazz players performing throughout the lunch playing soft melodies for all of the diners entertainment and i always believe with soothing music a meal is always made more enjoyable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking around this was definite a place i could fall in love with, beautiful flower bed arrangements with different colors that made the restaurant really pop, the large umbrella's which provided a nice cool atmosphere and most importantly shade, plus birds flying around during the meal and  nicely arranged plants i loved the ambiance. The food on the other hand could be improved, with such a nicely designed restaurant i would expect a vast selection, also my gf suggested that when your in a new place you should try new food and i 100% agree with that, but in this case i should have just gotten the salmon, because everything else i looked at on the menu, i just was not feeling. Had the veal meatballs style dish and it wasn't that great i'd say it was at best a 6 out of 10 if i had to grade it. But overall the decor/ambiance made up for that. Plus our waitress was extremely helpful/friendly. I also agree with some of the reviews a bit overpriced for what they were serving.\n",

       "3  The doctor was very nice, got in in a good amount of time and feel like the visit was acceptable. After seeing the doctor I selected my glasses, I was told about this great way they are ordered right from Oakley and how everything was done right at Oakley. I asked them if they could do a rush even said I would pay more. See explained it usually takes 5-7 business days. I was in on July 3 2014 and today July 23 2014 just got them. The lenses ARE NOT Oakley quality the tint is not even to the edge of the lens. I contacted Oakley to find out the aren't even Oakley lenses. Why did I order these and not even get what I ordered. Not happy at all would not recommended buying for brand from this company!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "4  The Nook is an immediate phoenix staple!  I came here and met up with the fam, I didn't really have any expectations whatsoever.  I feel like that is the best type of experience to have, it really gives any establishment the opportunity to wow their customers.  That's exactly what The Nook did for me.  I love how it is connected to a hotel with easy access from inside, also the decor was very modern and hipster-ish.  This \"new age\" restaurant atmosphere that numbers of restaurant owners have adopted is so amazing.  The Nook sets the ambiance to a very relaxed, comfortable feeling which makes it great to come in groups. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe mixologist Dustin is very skillful, and constructed the drink menu himself from my understanding.  He definitely sets the bar for any other bartender out there.  By experimenting with different aromas all the way to different types of seasonings.  He truly makes it a day to remember.  Check out my pics of the drinks he made, I attached the recipes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love how the city is coming to fruition, with so many new and upcoming restaurants like The Nook, it makes me proud to be a Phoenician.

You're looking at an overpriced salad that you've negotiated with the server to make sure you're getting food at all. I called ahead and planned something out with the manager, who was pretty helpful. But it did still mean I was paying a ridiculous amount of $$ for lettuce and a couple of strawberries. And for the most part they are terrible when dealing with people with dietary considerations:\\r\\n1. I ordered a salad and asked for no meat or cheese. You'd think they would put more of the other ingredients in it to compensate, but no - so I was essentially eating just lettuce with a very very sparse sprinkling of nuts. ALSO they served it WITH THE MEAT! and then clearly just took off the meat and gave it back to me instead of making a new one. EW. The manager apologized and said it wouldn't be charged - very nice. However, this didn't get communicated to the server who DID charge me for it!\\r\\n2. Their \"vegetarian green beans\" are made with beef broth! When I told the person that that wasn't \"vegetarian\" she argued it was \"just the broth\". I totally don't trust them at ALL to know what's in their food or to care if someone can't eat something.</td>\n",

I tend to alternate between the Singapore Noodle, Chicken Fried Rice and the Chow Mai Fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not the best Chinese food I've had, but I never had a complaint regarding the quality and quantity of my food.

       "2  Ugh. I've had to eat here a couple of times because of work events. This of course makes the scantily clad girls super awkward...\\r\\nIf you're vegan there is not much you can eat. You're looking at an overpriced salad that you've negotiated with the server to make sure you're getting food at all. I called ahead and planned something out with the manager, who was pretty helpful. But it did still mean I was paying a ridiculous amount of $$ for lettuce and a couple of strawberries. And for the most part they are terrible when dealing with people with dietary considerations:\\r\\n1. I ordered a salad and asked for no meat or cheese. You'd think they would put more of the other ingredients in it to compensate, but no - so I was essentially eating just lettuce with a very very sparse sprinkling of nuts. ALSO they served it WITH THE MEAT! and then clearly just took off the meat and gave it back to me instead of making a new one. EW. The manager apologized and said it wouldn't be charged - very nice. However, this didn't get communicated to the server who DID charge me for it!\\r\\n2. Their \"vegetarian green beans\" are made with beef broth! When I told the person that that wasn't \"vegetarian\" she argued it was \"just the broth\". I totally don't trust them at ALL to know what's in their food or to care if someone can't eat something.  \n",

       "4  Heard alot of good things about this place and decided to grab some breakfast burritos today. Have to say we enjoyed our burritos! We had the potato egg and cheese burrito and the chorizo potato and egg burrito.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly the burritos were rather large, you could easily share if not extremely hungry. But since we both ate our own, we probably won't need lunch! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hot sauce is excellent - spicy . They also have a green sauce and that one is milder but def flavorful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely will be back to try their other dishes.

You would think it would be easy for servers to routinely hit up tables as you pass by. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fiance ordered the Quinoa Salad, and said it was pretty good, but dry. I wasn't too hungry and so I simply ordered the Bruchetta 3-way which came with burnt crostinis. And I ordered a side of fries, which were either hard or chewy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend ordered the macaroni & cheese, and added chicken and bacon (her usual order) and liked it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCan't remember the last time I thought to myself- \"Huh... they failed at fries...\" So, like I said- two stars. But, the decor was good, it was a good place to have a conversation, and I might be back to try more expensive fare, but-... ah... the fry thing... yeeesh... I dunno, man...   \n",
       "2  I was staying at planet Hollywood across the street and saw good reviews on this place so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We love a good breakfast sandwich. We both ordered the bacon egg and cheese, cold brew, a biscuit and a salted caramel cookie. Everything tasted amazing! The egg is medium so it pops when you take a bite so be prepared for that. The cookie was absolutely delicious and the biscuit was soft and fluffy. We got there are around 10:30am and there was a line already. Luckily the line moves very quick and we were able to find seating. Highly recommend this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Unsere Tour war somit komplett kostenlos. (Inzwischen gibt es Ã¼ber MyVegas nur noch 2-fÃ¼r-1 oder 50$-Rabatt-Gutscheine.) Der Normalpreis fÃ¼r diese Tour liegt bei 189$ pro Person und wir haben das angemessen empfunden.\\r\\nWir wurden morgens am Hotel mit einem Mini-Van abgeholt und fuhren dann zu einem weiteren Hotel um die restlichen Teilnehmer einzuladen.\\r\\nWÃ¤hrend der Fahrt hat Chuck (unser Tourguide) uns gut unterhalten. \\r\\nVor Ort angekommen wartete schon Chris (vom Support) mit den Segways auf uns. FÃ¼r alle standen Helme, KopfhÃ¶rer und viel kaltes Wasser bereit. Nachdem jeder auf dem groÃem Parkplatz in die Bedienung des Segways eingewiesen wurde und sich sicher fÃ¼hlte, ging die Tour los.\\r\\nZuerst fuhren wir durch die Stadt zum Museum. Dort hatten wir ca. eine 1/2 Stunde Aufenthalt. Der Eintrittspreis ist bereits inklusive. Hier hat man auch die MÃ¶glichkeit zur Toilette zu gehen.\\r\\nDas Museum beschÃ¤ftigt sich mit dem Bau des Hoover Dams (fÃ¼r die Arbeiter wurde Boulder City damals gebaut) und ist recht interessant.\\r\\nDanach ging die Tour weiter und es gab richtig lange Strecken zu fahren. Die Strecken sind sehr gut gewÃ¤hlt, man gerÃ¤t nirgendwo in brenzlige Situationen und fÃ¼r \"Neugierige\" gibt es viele MÃ¶glichkeiten zu testen, was ein Segway so alles kann.\\r\\nAn einer Stelle hat uns Chuck \"Big Horn Sheeps\" versprochen, aber die hatten an dem Tag wohl schon etwas besseres vor. ;-)\\r\\nAuf einem Berg - im Hintergrund sehr malerisch der Lake Mead - wurde ein Erinnerungsfoto gemacht, dass uns hinterher per Mail zugesendet wurde (kostenlos).\\r\\nZum AbschluÃ fuhren wir dann noch zum Lunch (im Preis inklusive). Man wird bereits bei der Buchung gefragt, was man gerne essen mÃ¶chte. Bei uns standen 5 oder 6 Gerichte zur Auswahl. Die QualitÃ¤t war ... naja ... Wir wÃ¼rden dort jedenfalls keinesfalls nochmal hingehen. Insgesamt hat das Essen aber wohl doch bei einigen den Geschmack getroffen. Es sind jedenfalls sehr groÃe und fettige Portionen. Eiskalte Softdrinks waren dort ebenfalls inklusive.\\r\\nAnschlieÃend ging zurÃ¼ck zum Van.\\r\\nChuck ist auf dem RÃ¼ckweg noch mit uns zum Hoover Dam gefahren, dort gab es allerdings nur einen kurzen Stop. AnschlieÃend wurden alle wieder zu Ihren Hotel (oder zum Wunschziel) gefahren.\\r\\n\\r\\nWir werden auf jeden Fall wieder eine Tour buchen, denn uns hat es supergut gefallen. Die Segways waren top in Schuss, Chuck und Chris hatten allzeit ein Auge darauf, dass alle gut klar kommen und sind geduldig und freundlich mit jedem, der etwas zÃ¶gerlich ist. Chuck wusste viel Ã¼ber Boulder City zu erzÃ¤hlen.\\r\\nJedes Segway hat vorne einen Rucksack, in dem man seine persÃ¶nlichen Sachen und GetrÃ¤nke verstauen kann.\\r\\nUnser Tipp: Bei Sonne auf jeden Fall Sonnenschutz verwenden - und dabei die HÃ¤nde nicht vergessen!</td>\n",

Von 16-19 und und von 23-02 Uhr. In der ersten Phase, steigt der Preis bis 19 Uhr jeweils um einen Dollar und in der nÃ¤chtlichen Phase, fÃ¤llt der Preis, umso spÃ¤ter es wird. Witzige Idee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDie Preise sind ingesamt fÃ¼r Vegas aber sehr moderat und angenehmen. Die Speisenauswahl ist groÃ und bietet amerikanische KÃ¼che, aber auch internationale Gerichte.\\r\\nDas Bier-MenÃ¼ ist auch hier riesig und bietet eine groÃe Auswahl an Bieren vom Fass.\\r\\n\\r\\nDie erste Empfehlung beim Essen sind definitiv die Lobster &amp; Shrimp Mac'n'Cheese. Diese war der Hammer und mit dem Lobster-Fleisch und Shrimps toll. Die Portion war wirklich groÃ und fÃ¼r 19 Dollar vollkommen angemessen.\\r\\nAuch der Hangover Slopper war klasse. Ein Angus Beef Burger mit allem was so auf einen Burger gehÃ¶rt, dazu noch eine Cheese-Sauce und zwei Eiern. Auch eine Bombe, aber super lecker und mal etwas ganz Anderes, als andere Burger. Hatte ich in der Form noch nicht. Siehe meine Fotos. Ansonsten sind die Mini-Slider auch gut, drei kleine Burger fÃ¼r den Hunger zwischendurch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesonders zu empfehlen ist im Tom's auch noch der Baby Kale (GrÃ¼nkohl) Salat, als Caesar Variante mit Chicken. GrÃ¼nkohl als Salat ist wunderbar und hoffe, das es sich auch mehr in Deutschland durchsetzt. Super lecker, sehr gesund und geschmacklich auch mal ganz anders, als unsere Salatvarianten.\\r\\n\\r\\nDas Tom's Urban ist also immer ein guter Anlaufpunkt fÃ¼r einen Drink oder ein Essen. \\r\\nDer Service war Ã¼brigens durchweg sehr freundlich und super aufmerksam.

We had a reservation for 12pm but we still waited 45min to get seated because there was already a crowd of people still waiting for a table. I think it just has to be managed better, like have an app that customers can bid for tables or have organized seating times. I saw some people leave in frustration (i.e. banging the sh*t out of the handicap button to open the door); and while it's understandable to react like that when you're hungry, it's certainly not very mature and respectful behavior. Nevertheless, I guess you just have be patient if you want to eat their food..\\r\\n\\r\\nI think what business owners should realize is that if you have a less hectic environment in the front of the house, your customers will probably be more polite to the servers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food, I thought was really good, and again if you're patient enough to wait for your table, you get to order their BBQ pork. Tea wasn't that great, I mean it's called #é£²è¶ for a reason, so it gets -1 star, but the food is consistent. We just ordered alot of random things (that guy sold us on so many extra dishes), that by the end, everything gets cold and gummy, and lunch turns into the \"who ordered this on the sheet?!\" game. Nevertheless, it was fun to drink tea and catch up with your friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyways, the moral of this story is: be patient at the door, try and book your lunches during off peak hours (either 30min after opening or 3pm), be kind to your servers/compliment them once in a while, and  you'll have a better experience.. not like all the 1star reviews that you read on this.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. try not to drool on your cellphone screen.</td>\n",

       "4949   Wir haben im Mai die \"Historic Boulder City\"-Tour gemacht.\\r\\nGebucht haben wir von Deutschland aus per Mail und mit Gutscheinen von MyVegas. Unsere Tour war somit komplett kostenlos. (Inzwischen gibt es Ã¼ber MyVegas nur noch 2-fÃ¼r-1 oder 50$-Rabatt-Gutscheine.) Der Normalpreis fÃ¼r diese Tour liegt bei 189$ pro Person und wir haben das angemessen empfunden.\\r\\nWir wurden morgens am Hotel mit einem Mini-Van abgeholt und fuhren dann zu einem weiteren Hotel um die restlichen Teilnehmer einzuladen.\\r\\nWÃ¤hrend der Fahrt hat Chuck (unser Tourguide) uns gut unterhalten. \\r\\nVor Ort angekommen wartete schon Chris (vom Support) mit den Segways auf uns. FÃ¼r alle standen Helme, KopfhÃ¶rer und viel kaltes Wasser bereit. Nachdem jeder auf dem groÃem Parkplatz in die Bedienung des Segways eingewiesen wurde und sich sicher fÃ¼hlte, ging die Tour los.\\r\\nZuerst fuhren wir durch die Stadt zum Museum. Dort hatten wir ca. eine 1/2 Stunde Aufenthalt. Der Eintrittspreis ist bereits inklusive. Hier hat man auch die MÃ¶glichkeit zur Toilette zu gehen.\\r\\nDas Museum beschÃ¤ftigt sich mit dem Bau des Hoover Dams (fÃ¼r die Arbeiter wurde Boulder City damals gebaut) und ist recht interessant.\\r\\nDanach ging die Tour weiter und es gab richtig lange Strecken zu fahren. Die Strecken sind sehr gut gewÃ¤hlt, man gerÃ¤t nirgendwo in brenzlige Situationen und fÃ¼r \"Neugierige\" gibt es viele MÃ¶glichkeiten zu testen, was ein Segway so alles kann.\\r\\nAn einer Stelle hat uns Chuck \"Big Horn Sheeps\" versprochen, aber die hatten an dem Tag wohl schon etwas besseres vor. ;-)\\r\\nAuf einem Berg - im Hintergrund sehr malerisch der Lake Mead - wurde ein Erinnerungsfoto gemacht, dass uns hinterher per Mail zugesendet wurde (kostenlos).\\r\\nZum AbschluÃ fuhren wir dann noch zum Lunch (im Preis inklusive). Man wird bereits bei der Buchung gefragt, was man gerne essen mÃ¶chte. Bei uns standen 5 oder 6 Gerichte zur Auswahl. Die QualitÃ¤t war ... naja ... Wir wÃ¼rden dort jedenfalls keinesfalls nochmal hingehen. Insgesamt hat das Essen aber wohl doch bei einigen den Geschmack getroffen. Es sind jedenfalls sehr groÃe und fettige Portionen. Eiskalte Softdrinks waren dort ebenfalls inklusive.\\r\\nAnschlieÃend ging zurÃ¼ck zum Van.\\r\\nChuck ist auf dem RÃ¼ckweg noch mit uns zum Hoover Dam gefahren, dort gab es allerdings nur einen kurzen Stop. AnschlieÃend wurden alle wieder zu Ihren Hotel (oder zum Wunschziel) gefahren.\\r\\n\\r\\nWir werden auf jeden Fall wieder eine Tour buchen, denn uns hat es supergut gefallen. Die Segways waren top in Schuss, Chuck und Chris hatten allzeit ein Auge darauf, dass alle gut klar kommen und sind geduldig und freundlich mit jedem, der etwas zÃ¶gerlich ist. Chuck wusste viel Ã¼ber Boulder City zu erzÃ¤hlen.\\r\\nJedes Segway hat vorne einen Rucksack, in dem man seine persÃ¶nlichen Sachen und GetrÃ¤nke verstauen kann.\\r\\nUnser Tipp: Bei Sonne auf jeden Fall Sonnenschutz verwenden - und dabei die HÃ¤nde nicht vergessen!   \n",

       "13942  Das Tom's Urban wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt in Vegas schon zu unserem \"Stammlokal\", da es sich genau am New York New York Hotel befand, wo wir wohnten nur einen Katzensprung entfernt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBei Tom's kann man sowohl drinnen und klimatisiert sitzen, als auch sehr nett draussen.\\r\\nGerade Abends, wenn die Sonne untergegangen ist, ist das ein super Ort, um den Abend ausklingen zulassen, die vorbeilaufenden Menschen zu beobachten und die Happy Hour mitzunehmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiese gibt es zwei mal am Tag. Von 16-19 und und von 23-02 Uhr. In der ersten Phase, steigt der Preis bis 19 Uhr jeweils um einen Dollar und in der nÃ¤chtlichen Phase, fÃ¤llt der Preis, umso spÃ¤ter es wird. Witzige Idee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDie Preise sind ingesamt fÃ¼r Vegas aber sehr moderat und angenehmen. Die Speisenauswahl ist groÃ und bietet amerikanische KÃ¼che, aber auch internationale Gerichte.\\r\\nDas Bier-MenÃ¼ ist auch hier riesig und bietet eine groÃe Auswahl an Bieren vom Fass.\\r\\n\\r\\nDie erste Empfehlung beim Essen sind definitiv die Lobster & Shrimp Mac'n'Cheese. Diese war der Hammer und mit dem Lobster-Fleisch und Shrimps toll. Die Portion war wirklich groÃ und fÃ¼r 19 Dollar vollkommen angemessen.\\r\\nAuch der Hangover Slopper war klasse. Ein Angus Beef Burger mit allem was so auf einen Burger gehÃ¶rt, dazu noch eine Cheese-Sauce und zwei Eiern. Auch eine Bombe, aber super lecker und mal etwas ganz Anderes, als andere Burger. Hatte ich in der Form noch nicht. Siehe meine Fotos. Ansonsten sind die Mini-Slider auch gut, drei kleine Burger fÃ¼r den Hunger zwischendurch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesonders zu empfehlen ist im Tom's auch noch der Baby Kale (GrÃ¼nkohl) Salat, als Caesar Variante mit Chicken. GrÃ¼nkohl als Salat ist wunderbar und hoffe, das es sich auch mehr in Deutschland durchsetzt. Super lecker, sehr gesund und geschmacklich auch mal ganz anders, als unsere Salatvarianten.\\r\\n\\r\\nDas Tom's Urban ist also immer ein guter Anlaufpunkt fÃ¼r einen Drink oder ein Essen. \\r\\nDer Service war Ã¼brigens durchweg sehr freundlich und super aufmerksam. Freies Wlan gibt es vom New York Hotel noch obendrauf. Was will man mehr?! :-)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "25276  I thought I have written this restaurant but somehow couldn't find it in my review\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended by friend that it is good.  Browsing through its menu really found that there are a lot of varieties not found in traditional vegetarian Chinese restaurant.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most memorable dish is the A vegetable palm.  It is something different, soft but you can bite it.  Usually you can order fried A vegetable but never did I find the palm to be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presentation of all dishes are nice and clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end, the waitress introduced us äºå°å±±éè²è±è¶ Wu Tai flower tea that is good for your stomach.  We bought some to try.  This is a good place to have vegetarian dishes.  Whatever you pay minus expenses is used to fund the building of the Wu Tai temple in Pickering that is now under construction.  You can have a meal and at the same time do some fund raising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "34862  We came here for dim sum #é»å¿ on a Sat morning after being on vacation in Europe, so we we're definitely craving some good Chinese food. We had a reservation for 12pm but we still waited 45min to get seated because there was already a crowd of people still waiting for a table. I think it just has to be managed better, like have an app that customers can bid for tables or have organized seating times. I saw some people leave in frustration (i.e. banging the sh*t out of the handicap button to open the door); and while it's understandable to react like that when you're hungry, it's certainly not very mature and respectful behavior. Nevertheless, I guess you just have be patient if you want to eat their food..\\r\\n\\r\\nI think what business owners should realize is that if you have a less hectic environment in the front of the house, your customers will probably be more polite to the servers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food, I thought was really good, and again if you're patient enough to wait for your table, you get to order their BBQ pork. Tea wasn't that great, I mean it's called #é£²è¶ for a reason, so it gets -1 star, but the food is consistent. We just ordered alot of random things (that guy sold us on so many extra dishes), that by the end, everything gets cold and gummy, and lunch turns into the \"who ordered this on the sheet?!\" game. Nevertheless, it was fun to drink tea and catch up with your friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyways, the moral of this story is: be patient at the door, try and book your lunches during off peak hours (either 30min after opening or 3pm), be kind to your servers/compliment them once in a while, and  you'll have a better experience.. not like all the 1star reviews that you read on this.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. try not to drool on your cellphone screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "46639  I had the Tiroler GrÃ¶stl, a sampler of diced meats with German style potatoes. It was a tad salty for my usual taste, but overall very well prepared and seasoned. Service was very slow, and I had to wait much longer than usual for drink refills and general table service.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall assessment: Good food, dated decor, and waitresses leave much to be desired when it comes to attentiveness.  I would go back and back and try something new, in hopes that the lacking service was due to an off night and not normal operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

    "We will leave these examples intact, since the unlabeled dataset and test set may also contain special characters."

Very illegal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "13  I was so hoping things would improve for me with this overpriced foodstore. Unfortunately, certain staff members apparantly thinks their poop don't stink. Like the hippie idiotic woman who served me pizza tonite. I had asked her for some cheese pizza from the opposite end facing her. Sighing, she turned it around and cut a slice and then cut it in two. She then asked if I wanted the \"whole strip\". Well, there were now two pieces, weren't there?  So it confused me. So I bend down to see what she was doing, and just said \"um,\" and that was all it took for her to stay loudy and rudely \"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\".  Really sweetheart? I think I meant to say F O.  Hear that? Before boxing up my slices, she made sure to hastily scoop then up and bang them into the sides of the display, touching everything.  Classy, Miss Hippie. Did they teach you how to serve food at the dirt farm that was obviously your last place of employment?\\r\\n\\r\\nResidents of Las Vegas: if you too would like to experience overpriced food in a terribly designed strip mall with a dangerous and near impossible exit onto Rampart, coupled with service you expect to find in a junk store....all wrapped up in one...make sure you visit this location of Crap Foods.  Maybe next time I shouldn't wear my \"culture warrior\" shirt, lol. Hippies.   \n",
